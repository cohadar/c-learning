This is a cross-platform (win, nix, mac) project in C where I test making cross-platform projects in C :)

I use VS2013 on Windows7
I use Xcode on MacOSX
I use code::blocks on Ubuntu

General project structure:
	* src
	* resources
	* build
	  +--- Debug
	  +--- Release
	  +--- Intermediate
	* mac-xcode
	* nix-codeblocks
	* win-vse2013
    
    
NOTE: Using output directory as working directory saves a lot of hustle.
NOTE: Do not forget to close the IDE before doing a git commit.
