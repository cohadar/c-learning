I will try developing in codeblocks on all 3 platforms (win/mac/linux)

It turns out code::blocks has very bad support for clang compiler and apple stopped supporting gcc.

Lets try using Xcode on Mac, VSe on Windows and code::blocks on Ubuntu.

Xcode works fine for now, I will use different operating system every day to ensure cross-platform.

Try to avoid #ifdef mess.

There is a great benefit in manually setting xcode project

Setting code::blocks on Ubuntu with GCC compiler with -Wall -g -std=c99
-Wall is great; it catched some problems xcode did not.

Lost 4 hours installing win7 sp1 updates so I can install VSe2013

General project structure appears

Using output directory as working directory saves a lot of hustle.

Stupid code:blocks does not #define DEBUG in debug mode...
assert(3) man uses NDEBUG but I don't like double negations: #ifndef NDEBUG
I will just define DEBUG in debug build settings myself

Testing code is intertwined with normal code but this is fine for non-API .h files, for .c files it does not matter.

Fixed VA_ARGS support in greatest.h under VS2013 compiler.

Visual Studio: Tools->Options->Text Editor->C/C++->Formatting->Spacing

Created CODE_STYLE.h (adopted Carmack's code style a bit)

VS compiler needs end of source file to be on new line!
VS compiler does not have snprintf function.

MC_Panic module tested on all 3 platforms, it works!

Stupid gcc does not support static const int as a case: constant
